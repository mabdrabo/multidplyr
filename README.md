multidplyr is a backend for dplyr that partitions a data frame across multiple cores. You tell multidplyr how to split the data up with `partition()` and then the data stays on each node until you explicitly retrieve it with `collect()`. This minimises the amount of time spent moving data around, and maximises parallel performance. This idea is inspired by [partools](http://bit.ly/1Nve8v5) by Norm Matloff and [distributedR](http://bit.ly/1KZVAwK) by the Vertica Analytics team.

Due to the overhead associated with communicating between the nodes, you won't expect to see much performance improvement on basic dplyr verbs with less than ~10 million observations. However, you'll see improvements much faster if you're doing more complex operations with `do()`.
